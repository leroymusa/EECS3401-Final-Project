## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices in Pakistan using machine learning models. The original dataset was sourced from the "House Prices 2023 Dataset" on Gigasheet, which was modified and used for this project. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model selection, and evaluation.

## Dataset
- Original Dataset Source: [House Prices 2023 Dataset](https://www.gigasheet.com/sample-data/house-prices-2023-dataset)
- Modified Dataset: [Student Performance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leroymusa/EECS3401-Final-Project/main/house_prices.csv)

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
1. **Looking at the Big Picture**: Defines the task and describes the dataset.
2. **Acquiring Dataset**: Code snippets to import the dataset and view its basic information.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and analysis of the dataset to understand its characteristics.
4. **Preparing the Dataset for Machine Learning Models**: Data preprocessing steps including handling missing values, removing unnecessary columns, and scaling numerical features.
5. **Model Selection and Training**: Implementation of various regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Gradient Boosting Regression.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluation of model performances using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score.
7. **Model Visualization**: Visualizations including scatter plots and residual plots to analyze model predictions.
8. **Conclusion**: Summary of the project and final remarks.
